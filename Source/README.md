How to build
============

- On Linux Ubuntu, install Qt Creator and a few dependencies:

```
sudo apt install \
  qtcreator \
  qtdeclarative5-dev \
  libqt5core5a \
  libqt5gui5 \
  libqt5qml5 \
  qtdeclarative5-localstorage-plugin \
  qml-module-qtquick-controls 
```

- Then open the `qtHue.pro` file in Qt Creator.
- Finally click the green play button that should be available on the bottom left corner of Qt Creator
